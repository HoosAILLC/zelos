/**
 * test/cli.test.mjs — the package, and the four things you can type.
 *
 * Two halves:
 *
 *  1. **The package.** `npm pack` is run for real, the tarball is extracted to
 *     a temp directory, and the program is run from that clean copy with no
 *     `node_modules` anywhere near it. "It has no dependencies" and "the
 *     published tarball works" are claims about an artefact; the only honest
 *     way to check them is to build the artefact and run it.
 *
 *  2. **The command line.** `zelos`, `zelos sweep`, `zelos doctor`, `zelos mcp`.
 *     Every subprocess here gets a throwaway ZELOS_HOME and is forced onto the
 *     encrypted-file secret backend, so no test can touch the real ~/.zelos or
 *     the operator's keychain. The only sockets opened are to mock servers on
 *     127.0.0.1.

 * Find a way to run npm that does not go through a shell.
 *

 * there is `npm.cmd`, a batch shim — so `spawn('npm', …)` fails with ENOENT and
 * takes every test in the suite below down with it before a single assertion
 * runs. That is what the Windows job was reporting.
 *
 * The obvious repair, spawning `npm.cmd`, does not work either: since the fix
 * for CVE-2024-27980 Node refuses to spawn a `.cmd` or `.bat` file unless
 * `shell: true` is set, and every Node in this project's matrix carries that
 * fix. And `shell: true` is the wrong answer regardless — it hands the argument
 * list to cmd.exe to re-parse, so a temp path with a space in it (which is
 * exactly what os.tmpdir() can hand us) stops being one argument. A test whose
 * job is to check what we publish must not introduce a quoting bug of its own.
 *
 * So skip the shim and do what the shim does: run npm's own entry script under
 * this Node. That is one code path on all three platforms with no shell and no
 * quoting rules anywhere in it, and it has the side benefit of pinning the test
 * to the npm that ships with the Node under test rather than whatever npm

    /* REGRESSION, and the reason "--version runs from the clean extract" above
       could not catch it: that test spawns `node zelos.mjs`, which is not how
       anybody who installs this ever invokes it.

       `npm install` writes node_modules/.bin/zelos as a SYMLINK to
       ../zelos-app/zelos.mjs on macOS and Linux. Node resolves the real path of
       the ESM main entry but hands `argv[1]` over exactly as the shell wrote
       it, so the launcher's `path.resolve(process.argv[1]) === fileURLToPath(
       import.meta.url)` compared the link against its target, never matched,
       and `main()` was simply never called. Measured on the packed tarball
       installed three ways — local, `-g` and `npx` — all three produced
       symlinks, and `zelos --version`, `--help`, `doctor` and `sweep` each
       printed nothing, exited 0, and never created $ZELOS_HOME.

       Exit 0 with no output is what makes it expensive rather than merely
       broken: docs/INSTALL.md recommends `zelos sweep` for a cron job
       precisely because "it exits non-zero if the sweep failed", so that cron
       job would have reported success every night while sweeping nothing.

       So this installs the real tarball and runs the real bin entry. Anything
       cheaper — a unit test of the comparison, a spawn of zelos.mjs by path —
       reproduces the shape of the bug without its cause, which is the symlink
       only npm creates. Windows never reaches here (this whole suite is
       skipped there) and could not fail this way anyway: npm writes a .cmd
       shim carrying a real path rather than a link. */

  /**
   * REGRESSION, in two halves that landed a wave apart.
   *
   * `commandSweep` attached SIGINT and SIGTERM listeners, which removes Node's
   * default terminate-on-signal — so from that moment Ctrl-C did whatever those
   * listeners said and nothing else. What they said was `controller.abort()`,
   * silently, and abort was observed only between mailboxes while the mail
   * reader did not forward the signal into its socket at all. Measured against
   * this same mock: six SIGINTs and a SIGTERM all set `aborted` and changed
   * nothing, and the process held the terminal for 27 seconds without printing
   * a character. The `run` path prints "Stopping (SIGINT)."; this one printed
   * nothing, which is the whole difference between a program that is stopping
   * and a program that is stuck.
   *
   * The first half of the fix was the launcher's: say so, bound the wait with a
   * 5s unref'd escape timer, and let a second signal through. The tests here
   * were written against that, and asserted that one signal was NOT enough —
   * that the read held on and the timer was what ended the run, exit 128+signal.
   *
   * The second half then threaded `signal` into the reader
   * (core/sources/imap.mjs:627-634 — an abort fails the command in flight and
   * destroys the socket), and that turned those assertions upside down: one
   * signal now ends the run in about a tenth of a second, the escape timer never
   * comes due, and the exit code is the sweep's own 1 for a run that did not
   * finish rather than 130/143 from `leave()`. Both are non-zero, which is what
   * the crontab in docs/INSTALL.md reads, and "it stopped when I asked" is the
   * better product.
   *
   * So these two tests now assert the opposite of what they used to, and the
   * assertion that carries the weight is the one saying the timer did NOT fire:
   * put the reader back to ignoring its signal and the wait goes from ~100ms to
   * the full grace, with "that source will not let go" underneath it.
   *
   * What that leaves untested, said out loud rather than quietly dropped:
   * `leave()`'s 128+signal exit and the "Stopping now" second-signal branch
   * (zelos.mjs:539-556) are no longer reachable through the front door, because
   * every source Zelos has — IMAP, CalDAV/ICS fetches, and the model call —
   * honours the signal now. They are a net for a source that stops honouring
   * it, and nothing here can stage one without a hole in production code.
