  /* REGRESSION, and it reached a release build before anything caught it.
     `core/connectors/linear.mjs` and its test both used `nemo@` followed by the
     operator's real company domain as a fixture address — the one this test
     forbids, spelled out here only as a description because writing it would
     make this file fail its own check. `nemo` is the house's fictional person
     and is fine; the DOMAIN is a real business, in a public repository, in a
     file that ships inside the source zip and inside every desktop bundle.

     It survived being written, reviewed by a second agent, merged, and built —
     because the only thing that had ever checked for this was a grep I ran by
     hand at packaging time, and a check that depends on somebody remembering is
     not a check. This is that grep, as a test.

     Fixtures must use a RESERVED name: `.example`, `.test`, `.invalid`, or
     `example.com` (RFC 2606 / 6761). Those can never resolve, so a fixture
     address can never become mail to a real person. `github.com/HoosAILLC/zelos`
     is the project's own public URL and is allowed by name — it is a fact about
     where the code lives, not a personal detail.

     Three things this deliberately does NOT flag, each of which it did on the
     first run:

     `nemo` is the house's fictional person and appears in scores of fixtures.
     Only a REAL name is a leak.

     `/users/nemo/` in a CalDAV path is a URL, not a home directory. The
     home-path rule is case-SENSITIVE for exactly this reason: macOS writes
     `/Users/`, while a server path is lowercase, and an `/i` here turned every
     Nextcloud principal URL in test/caldav.test.mjs into a false positive.

     And this comment cannot spell the domain it forbids, or the guard fails on
     itself — which is why the rule below is assembled rather than written out. */

     core/connectors/ for a bare `fetch(` and fails on a hit". Until this
     existed, that test did not — a documented guard that was not there, which
     is the same shape as a guard that only checks a file MENTIONS something.

     It is worth having for its own sake, not just to make the sentence true.
     The transport is where the origin allow-list, the one-hop redirect rule,
     the byte cap, the timeout, the rate budget and the credential redaction all
     live, and the reason they are written once is that writing them a sixth
     time for the sixth connector is how docs/SECURITY.md's claim — that you can
     watch Zelos with tcpdump and see only what you configured — stops being
     true. A connector that calls global `fetch` silently opts out of all of it,
     and nothing about the resulting code looks wrong.

     `http.mjs` itself is exempt: it is the file that does the fetching.

     `ics.mjs` is exempt BY NAME and on purpose, and the name is the point. Its
     `fetchIcsText` predates the transport and hand-rolls the same protections —
     `redirect: 'manual'` with a one-hop rule, credentials dropped when the hop
     leaves the origin, `AbortSignal.timeout`, and a byte cap — so it is not a
     hole; it is the DUPLICATION this transport exists to end, and the audit
     already found real defects in one of the hand-rolled copies. Exempting it
     by name rather than loosening the rule means a NEW bare fetch in any other
     connector still fails here, and that migrating ics.mjs is a one-line
     deletion from this list rather than a rediscovery. */
