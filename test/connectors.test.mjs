/**
 * test/connectors.test.mjs — the seam, and one connector written against it.
 *
 * Two things are being proved here and they are different things.
 *
 * THE SEAM. That `core/connectors/index.mjs` is what config validation and the
 * run loop actually read, rather than a second hardcoded list sitting beside the
 * ones that were there before. The strongest available proof is a source type
 * that did not exist when the run loop was written — `rss`, in `config.sources`,
 * a config key nothing read a week ago — arriving on the board with no branch
 * anywhere in core/sweep.mjs naming it. If the sweep still held a list, that
 * source would be invisible.
 *
 * THE CONNECTOR. RSS was chosen for the proof because it needs no credential and
 * no vendor account: every test below runs against a real HTTP server on
 * 127.0.0.1 with no secret store involved. A contract that were awkward for a
 * source this plain would be the wrong contract.
 *
 * The secret backend is forced anyway. Nothing here reaches core/secrets.mjs —
 * the feed has no credential — but `runSweep` resolves `getSecret` from
 * DEFAULT_DEPS unless a test replaces it, and a test that forgot to would
 * otherwise read the operator's own login keychain.

 * possible without a second server.
 *
 * Closed in the TEST's `after`, not the file's, and that is not tidiness. Every
 * one of these binds an ephemeral port, node:test runs the suite's files in
 * parallel, and test/server.test.mjs asserts that a server offered a busy port
 * lands on exactly `busy + 1`. Holding a dozen listeners open for the length of
 * this file made that assertion fail roughly one run in four — a real defect in
 * a test that had been stable, caused entirely by a neighbour. One or two live

     `fetchIcsText`, so `kind: 'webcal'` produced a real row — events if the URL
     served a calendar, a named error in the Now banner if it did not.

     Dispatching strictly instead made the row VANISH: a calendar the user can
     see in Settings, contributing nothing, with nothing anywhere saying why.
     The registry does have the right answer for that — `unknownSources()` —
     which had no production reader when this was written.

     IT HAS ONE NOW: core/doctor.mjs reads it and names every entry no connector
     claims, asserted in test/connector-seam.test.mjs. So the condition this

     between here and a strict dispatch. It is still asserted as a fallback
     because the change belongs in its own diff: the assertion, the comment
     above it and core/connectors/index.mjs's own note all move together, and
     folding that into the pass that built the reader would make both
