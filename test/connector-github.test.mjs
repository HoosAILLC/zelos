/**
 * test/connector-github.test.mjs — the notifications reader, against a real
 * socket.
 *
 * This file exists because an adversarial review proved the connector had NO
 * behavioural coverage: nine mutations applied at once — `direction: 'out'`,
 * `uid: null`, the no-id guard deleted, the pulls-to-issues rewrite deleted,
 * the To line blanked, `participating` forced false, `all=false` flipped to
 * `all=true`, the `If-Modified-Since` header deleted, and the short-page break
 * deleted — left the whole suite green. Every one of those is a defect a
 * refactor could reintroduce with no signal, and two of them (`uid: null` and
 * the To line) are the exact failures other connectors already have dedicated
 * tests for.
 *
 * Nothing here contacts github.com. A loopback server answers, which is also
 * the only way to assert on the REQUEST — the conditional header, the
 * participating flag, the pagination stop — and the request is half of what
 * this connector is.
