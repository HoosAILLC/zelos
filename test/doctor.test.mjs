/**
 * test/doctor.test.mjs — the checks `zelos doctor` makes, and the ones it did
 * not make.
 *
 * `test/cli.test.mjs` already covers the shape of the report, the exit code and
 * the command line. This file is about the diagnosis itself, and every group in
 * it exists because doctor once returned "Nothing is broken" about a machine
 * that was:
 *
 *  1. **The database.** `diagnose()` imported nothing from ./db.mjs and the
 *     folder check only `existsSync`ed zelos.db, so a file the app dies on at
 *     launch read as "✓ Data folder … database present".
 *  2. **The sent folder.** It was deliberately excluded from the folders the
 *     mail check asks the server for, and then the pass line printed
 *     "reading INBOX" about an account whose every sweep was failing.
 *  3. **The secret store.** `backend()` answers "which store is in use", which
 *     since the pin landed is not the same question as "which store answered".
 *  4. **The settings file.** `loadConfig()` repairs a scalar section on the way
 *     in with nothing but a log line, so doctor called a file "valid" seconds
 *     after the user's identity block had been thrown away.
 *  5. **Redirects.** Both `.ics` readers outside the sweep handed redirect
 *     policy to `fetch`, which follows twenty of them.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the real home or the real keychain: ZELOS_HOME is a
 * throwaway and the backend is forced to the encrypted file before any core
 * module loads.

/**
 * These lived in `checkCalendar` as `if (calendar.kind === 'file')` and
 * `if (calendar.kind === 'caldav')` and had no test of their own: the group
 * above only ever exercises the http reader, so the two branches a user with a
 * local file or a Fastmail account actually takes were carried by nothing.
 *
 * They now live in core/connectors/file.mjs and core/connectors/caldav.mjs, and
 * doctor reaches them through `connector.check(source, ctx)` rather than by
 * knowing what kinds exist. What is pinned here is the SENTENCES, because they
 * are what the person who is stuck reads, and a refactor that quietly reworded
 * them would be a regression no other assertion could see.
