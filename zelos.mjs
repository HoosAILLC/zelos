/**
 * zelos.mjs — the launcher.
 *
 * Bare `zelos` is the whole product: open the database, migrate it, start the
 * local server, print the one URL that gets you in, and open a browser at it.
 * Three subcommands hang off the side of that — `sweep`, `doctor` and `mcp` —
 * and none of them changes what the bare invocation does.
 *
 * Three ordering rules shape this file:
 *
 *   1. `--home` has to be in the environment BEFORE anything resolves where
 *      Zelos lives, so the heavy modules are imported after flags are parsed,
 *      not at the top of the file. That also makes `--help` and `--version`
 *      instant: neither pays for sqlite, TLS or the model adapter.
 *   2. The app must start even when nothing is configured. A missing model, no
 *      mail account, an unreachable keychain — none of those are a reason to
 *      refuse to boot. Walking the user through setup is the UI's job, and the
 *      UI cannot do it if the server never came up.
 *   3. `zelos mcp` owns stdout: it is a JSON-RPC channel, and one stray banner
 *      line corrupts the stream. Everything conversational goes to stderr.

Zelos — a local-first second brain.

  zelos [options]           Run it. This is the one you want.
  zelos sweep [options]     Read your sources once, think about them, print
                            what changed, and stop.
  zelos doctor [options]    Check every part of the setup and say, in plain
                            words, what to do about whatever is wrong.
  zelos mcp [options]       Serve the read-only MCP tools on stdin/stdout so
                            another AI client can read your board.

Options:
  --port <n>      Port to listen on (default 7777, or $ZELOS_PORT).
                  If it is busy, Zelos walks up until it finds a free one.
  --home <dir>    Where Zelos keeps its data (default ~/.zelos).
  --no-open       Do not open a browser; just print the URL.
  --sweep-now     Run a sweep immediately on start.
  --mode <kind>   sweep only: "full" asks the model, "light" just re-reads
                  your sources and re-sorts the board. Default full.
  --json          sweep and doctor only: print the result as JSON instead of
                  as sentences.
  --version       Print the version and exit.
  --help          Print this and exit.

Zelos listens on 127.0.0.1 only, and every request to its API needs the
session token printed in the launch URL. That token is new on every launch,
so the previous URL stops working when you restart.

The one exception is /api/mcp, the read-only channel an AI client uses. It
is off until you switch it on in Settings, and it carries the separate AI
token you mint there rather than the session token — that one is meant to
outlive a restart, and it lasts until you turn AI access off or revoke it.

           to a real directory the guard no longer recognises. Measured before

           separating a work home from a personal one must never get. It is a
           mistyped flag, not a request for the default, so it stops the run.

           `docs/INSTALL.md` recommends `zelos sweep` for cron, so `--home
           ${VAR}` with VAR unset is the documented shape of the mistake.

/**
 * Opening the app without putting the session token on a command line.
 *
 * That token is the whole local API: anything holding it can read every message
 * Zelos has. An argument vector is not private — on Linux `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`
 * is world-readable, and everywhere else `ps` shows a co-resident process the
 * full command line for as long as it runs. `open "…/?t=<token>"` handed the
 * credential to exactly that. core/secrets.mjs already refuses to do this with
 * passwords, feeding `security` and `secret-tool` on stdin instead; this is the
 * same leak wearing a different hat, and it gets the same answer.
 *
 * What replaces it depends on what the platform can actually do, because the
 * opener is not the only process involved — whatever it launches ends up with
 * the URL too:
 *
 *  - **A handoff URL, when the server offers one.** A single-use nonce that the
 *    server trades for the real token on first request and then forgets. It may
 *    sit in an argument vector safely: by the time anyone reads it there, it has
 *    already been spent. This is the only route that is both private and
 *    automatic on every platform, so it wins whenever it is available.
 *  - **macOS without one.** `osascript` reads its script from stdin, and
 *    `open location` hands the URL to LaunchServices, which passes it to the
 *    browser as an Apple Event rather than as an argument. Nothing anywhere gets
 *    a command line with the token in it.
 *  - **Windows without one.** `cmd` reads `start` from stdin, which keeps the
 *    token out of the opener's own arguments. The browser it launches may still
 *    receive the URL as an argument; this is strictly better, not perfect.
 *  - **Everything else without one.** `xdg-open` takes a positional argument and
 *    execs a browser with another, so there is no way to do this privately at
 *    all. The browser is opened at the tokenless address and the user pastes the
 *    URL the banner printed. Refusing to leak beats opening the right page.
 *
 * The URL is always ours, built from the port we bound and the token we minted,
 * and it is checked against a tight character set before any of this — a value
 * from anywhere else has no business being handed to `cmd`.

       - Bound the wait. The exit timer is unref'd, so it can only fire while

         stuck read. A sweep that unwinds normally exits before it comes due.

/**
 * Whether this file is the program being run, rather than a module somebody
 * imported for `parseArgs` or `browserLaunchPlan`.
 *
 * The obvious spelling — `path.resolve(process.argv[1]) === fileURLToPath(
 * import.meta.url)` — is wrong through npm's bin, and wrong in the silent
 * direction. `npm install` writes `node_modules/.bin/zelos` as a symlink to
 * `../zelos-app/zelos.mjs` on macOS and Linux, and Node resolves the real path
 * of the ESM main entry but leaves `argv[1]` exactly as the shell handed it
 * over. So the two sides are the symlink and its target, they never match, and
 * `main()` is never called: measured on a packed tarball installed three ways
 * (local, `-g`, `npx`), `zelos --version`, `--help`, `doctor` and `sweep` each
 * printed nothing, exited 0, and never created `$ZELOS_HOME`. Exit 0 is what
 * makes it expensive — `docs/INSTALL.md` recommends `zelos sweep` for a cron
 * job "because it exits non-zero if the sweep failed", and that cron job would
 * have reported success forever while sweeping nothing. `node
 * --preserve-symlinks-main` flipped the behaviour, which is what named the
 * cause.
 *
 * Resolving both sides settles it either way round: through the symlink they
 * meet at the target, and with `--preserve-symlinks-main` they meet at the
 * link. The realpath is in a try/catch because it touches the filesystem and a
 * missing or unreadable path must not be a crash at import time; the fallback
 * is the old comparison, which is right whenever no symlink is involved.
 * Windows is unaffected either way — npm writes a cmd shim carrying a real
 * path there rather than a link — but it costs nothing to be correct on.
