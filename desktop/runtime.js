/**
 * desktop/runtime.js — the Zelos core, running inside the Electron main process.
 *
 * There is no second Node process. `zelos.mjs` and this file do the same six
 * things — load the config, open and migrate the database, build the server,
 * arm the scheduler, bind 127.0.0.1, hand back the URL — and forking a child
 * would only buy a second copy of sqlite fighting over the same WAL, plus a pipe
 * to marshal shutdown across. Electron's main process *is* Node; the core is
 * imported into it directly.
 *
 * Nothing here imports Electron, and the core is reached through `root` rather
 * than a static specifier, because that path moves when the app is packaged:
 * in development the core sits next to this file at `../core`, and in a build it
 * is unpacked into `Contents/Resources`. One argument, one place to be wrong.
 *
 * The lock on the data home used to live in this file, and that is why it did
 * not exist in the published npm package: `desktop/` is deliberately not in
 * `package.json`'s `files`, so `zelos.mjs`'s import of it threw into a catch on
 * every installed copy. It now lives in `core/home-lock.mjs`, which both entry
 * points can actually reach. `../core/home-lock.mjs` is the one static core
 * specifier in this file, and it is safe for the same reason `root` is correct:
 * the shell computes `ROOT` as `resourcesPath` when packaged and as this
 * directory's parent otherwise, and those are the same directory — the app's
 * own files are unpacked to `Contents/Resources/app/`, one level under the
 * `Contents/Resources/core/` the extraResources rule writes. The module also
 * imports nothing but node builtins and holds no state, so there is nothing a
 * second copy of it could get wrong even if some caller passed a different root.
