/**
 * desktop/main.js — the Electron shell.
 *
 * A window, a tray icon, a menu bar, and the Zelos core running in this same
 * process. That last part is the design: `runtime.js` imports `createServer`
 * and calls it here rather than forking `zelos.mjs` as a child, so there is
 * one process, one sqlite handle, one lifecycle, and no pipe between the tray
 * and the thing the tray is driving.
 *
 * What the shell is careful about:
 *
 *   - The window is pointed at the local board and nothing else. `guard.js`
 *     classifies every navigation and every window-open; anything that is not
 *     this server's own origin either goes to the system browser or is refused
 *     outright. Mail is attacker-controlled, and a link in it must never be
 *     able to load inside a window that holds the session token.
 *   - The renderer has no privileges: context isolation on, node integration
 *     off, sandbox on, `<webview>` off, and a preload that exposes four strings
 *     and one function — "show the Zelos folder", answered only for the
 *     board's own window and carrying nothing the page chose.
 *   - The session cancels every outbound request that is not the board itself —
 *     on every scheme Chromium will put on the network, WebSockets included,
 *     and not only the http(s) a scheme wildcard would have shown it. WebRTC,
 *     which never becomes a request at all, is blocked in the board's CSP and
 *     stripped of UDP underneath that. The session also denies every
 *     permission but the one the Owed view's copy buttons use.
 *     Spellcheck is off because Chromium fetches its dictionaries from Google,
 *     and this app does not talk to anyone the user did not configure.
 *   - Nothing here assumes it succeeded. There may be no tray icon, so closing
 *     the window may have nowhere to hide to; the renderer may die repeatedly,
 *     so a reload is rationed rather than automatic; and another Zelos may
 *     already hold the data home, which the shell reports instead of quietly
 *     becoming the second scheduler sweeping one database.
 *
 * `ready` is exported so the shell can be booted and inspected without a
 * packaged build; it resolves rather than rejects, because a shell that throws
 * on start would leave the user with no window and no message.

 *

 * app with no window, no icon and no way back short of killing it. Nothing
 * Electron exposes can prove the icon is on screen, so the honest answer is
 * that on Linux this cannot be detected: closing the window closes the app
 * unless the person running it has said out loud that their tray works, with
