/**
 * ui/app.js — the shell: chrome, routing, and the one render loop.
 *
 * Two decisions here are worth knowing about.
 *
 * 1. **The main view re-renders on `state.rev`, not on every store event.** A
 *    sweep emits progress several times a second; rebuilding the view on each
 *    one would wipe out a draft someone is halfway through typing. The chrome
 *    (counts, sweep line) is cheap and repaints on every event — but the quick
 *    capture panel inside it DOES hold input, so the chrome is updated in
 *    place around a panel that is built exactly once and never rebuilt. And
 *    because "the data changed" can arrive while a cursor is inside a form in
 *    the view too, a board-driven re-render is deferred until that field blurs.
 *
 * 2. **Nothing is ever assembled from a string.** Every node below comes from
 *    ui/lib/dom.js, which has no innerHTML path at all — a subject line is text,
 *    whatever it contains.

/**
 * Where focus lands after a sub-route move.
 *
 * A view change starts at the top of the content — that is what <main
 * tabindex="-1"> is for. A SUB-route change is a different animal: the control
 * that caused it lives inside the view, and `replace(main, currentView())` has
 * just detached it, so focus falls to <body>. Every Settings panel did that on
 * every switch: `aria-selected` was written onto a freshly built button
 * nobody was focused on, so the change was announced to no one, and the next
 * Tab restarted from whatever fallback the browser happened to keep.
 *
 * The rebuilt TAB is where focus goes back to, and that is now a choice rather
 * than the only option: settings.js finished the tablist, so the panel it
 * builds carries `role="tabpanel"`, `aria-labelledby` and `tabindex="-1"`, and
 * the selected tab carries `aria-controls` (ui/views/settings.js:1172-1199).
 * Either node can be focused. The tab is still right for two reasons:
 *
 *  - It is what the ARIA tabs pattern says, and it is what the reader is owed.
 *    Landing on the button reads "Privacy, tab, selected" — the selection that
 *    just happened. Landing on the panel reads its label and says nothing about
 *    which of the nine tabs is now on.
 *  - The strip uses a roving tabindex — the selected tab is `tabindex="0"` and
 *    the other eight are `-1` — so the strip is a single Tab stop. Focus on the
 *    tab leaves the rest of the panel ahead of the reader; focus on the panel
 *    would put the whole strip behind them, reachable only by Shift+Tab.
 *
 * The selector is `[role="tab"][aria-selected="true"]`, so those roles are
 * load-bearing in both files; settings.js says so on its side too.
 *
 * Two sub-routes are deliberately left where they are, both by the same `if`:
 * one with no tablist behind it (`#/calendar/2026-08-11`), where yanking focus
 * on a date change would be this bug pointed the other way, and a Settings hash
 * naming a panel that does not exist (`#/settings/bogus`), where no tab is
 * selected and there is nothing truthful to move to.
