/**
 * ui/views/ask.js — a question against your own index.
 *
 * The answer is streamed from POST /api/ask, which grounds it in FTS5 hits over
 * your mail, calendar, items and notes. The sources arrive first, as their own
 * SSE event, and they are rendered before a single token of the answer — so what
 * the model was allowed to look at is visible whether or not you like what it
 * said.
 *
 * This view owns a persistent root node. A sweep finishing mid-answer must not
 * re-render the transcript out from under a stream that is still running.
 *
 * An answer in progress can be stopped, and stopping keeps every word that had
 * already arrived — a long answer going the wrong way is a thing you interrupt,
 * not a thing you throw away. A question that failed goes back into the field
 * for the same reason: the retry is the point, and retyping it is not.
