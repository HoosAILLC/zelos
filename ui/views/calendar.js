/**
 * ui/views/calendar.js — a real time grid.
 *
 * The rule that governs every number in this file: a chip's position comes from
 * the wall-clock minutes in the event's own ISO string, read with a regex
 * (ui/lib/time.js, mirroring core/time.mjs). Passing `2026-08-11T14:00:00-04:00`
 * through `new Date()` and asking for `getHours()` re-expresses it in the
 * viewer's zone — open the same calendar on a laptop set to UTC and every chip
 * slides four hours. So Date is never consulted for placement here.
 *
 * Overlaps are packed cluster-then-greedy-column (see format.js `packColumns`),
 * and month cells sort conflicts first so a triple-booked day cannot hide behind
 * "+4".
 *
 * The grid opens where the day is, not at 00:00: the now-line when today is on
 * screen, otherwise the first event in the range. It does that on arrival and
 * when the range moves — never on the re-render a finished sweep causes, which
 * would drag a reader back to the morning while they were looking at Thursday
 * evening.
 *
 * And the second rule, which the arrows used to break: THIS GRID IS ONLY EVER A
 * VIEW OF ONE WINDOW. `/api/state` serves the events around today and says so in
 * `eventWindow`; there is no route that fetches another range, and nothing here
 * refetches. So ‹ and › stop at the served edge, and any day inside a range that
 * the window does not cover is drawn as unserved rather than as free. Without
 * that the calendar answered questions it had not been given the data for:
 * measured 2026-08-10, November drew 35 fully styled empty cells, October drew
 * 22, and August's own grid — which begins 2026-07-26 — drew eight, for days
 * whose events were sitting in the local database the whole time.
