 *
 * A word on words. The code says "sweep" and "model" because those are the
 * names the engine uses; the screen says "check" and "AI" because those are
 * the names a person uses, and the audit's reader heard a broom in the first
 * and a model car in the second. Nothing on this screen names an address the
 * person did not type: a failure on a fresh install says no AI has been chosen,
