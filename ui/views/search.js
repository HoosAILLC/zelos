/**
 * ui/views/search.js — the index, asked directly.
 *
 * Everything a sweep has ever read is in one FTS5 table: mail, calendar events,
 * the items the model raised and the notes you typed. GET /api/search has been
 * answering questions about it since the first version; until now nothing in
 * the app could ask one, so the only way to find a message from March was to
 * remember which day it landed on.
 *
 * Three things shape this view.
 *
 *  1. **A result is a reference, not a record.** The server returns
 *     `{ref, kind, title, excerpt, score}` — `msg:…`, `evt:…`, `item:…`,
 *     `cap:…` — and refuses to hand back bodies. So a hit shows enough to
 *     recognise, and where the board can actually open the thing behind it, it
 *     offers the way there and not otherwise. A button that navigates nowhere
 *     is worse than no button.
 *  2. **The last word wins.** Each keystroke supersedes the query before it, so
 *     a request in flight is aborted rather than left to land late and overwrite
 *     newer results with older ones.
 *  3. **The view owns a persistent root.** A sweep finishing must not wipe a
 *     query someone typed, so this module keeps its nodes between renders — the
 *     same arrangement ui/views/ask.js makes for the same reason.
