/**
 * Order a day's events so a real conflict comes ahead of every other TIMED
 * entry — the whole reason a month cell truncates is that most days are dull,
 * and the day that is not must say so in the three rows it gets.
 *
 * All-day entries are held OUT of the overlap pass and merged back at the top
 * for display. eventSpanOnDay gives an all-day event minutes 0–1440, so in the
 * pass it overlapped literally everything: one birthday flagged every event on
 * the day, the month cell painted a "clash" badge over a day where nothing
 * clashes — and, worse, the tiebreak collapsed to a constant and the sort
 * degraded to plain start order. Measured on a day holding a real double
 * booking: the three visible rows went from `REAL-CLASH-A, REAL-CLASH-B, 8am`
 * to `HOLIDAY, 8am, 9am`, so adding a holiday silently disabled the one thing
 * this function exists to do. A thing that runs all day is not a conflict with
 * anything; it is the day.
 *
 * Where the guarantee stops, said plainly, because an earlier version of this
 * comment promised more than the code does: all-day entries sort above
 * everything, and the month cell paints `MONTH_VISIBLE` rows —
 * `ui/views/calendar.js:566`, three of them — so a day carrying three or more
 * of them pushes the clashing pair behind "+N more" whatever their flags say.
 * Measured with a birthday, a holiday and a PTO day plus a 9:00/9:30 double
 * booking — visible rows `BIRTHDAY, HOLIDAY, PTO`.
 *
 * That "three" is the one number in this paragraph that belongs to another
 * file, so it is not left on trust. The test behind this boundary reads
 * MONTH_VISIBLE out of calendar.js rather than restating it — it used to carry
 * its own `const MONTH_VISIBLE = 3` beside a line number that had already
 * moved — so widening the cell to four rows turns that test red instead of
 * leaving this sentence quietly false.
 *
 * What the day does NOT do is go quiet: `monthCell` derives its `has-conflict`
 * badge from `spans.some(s => s.conflict)` over the whole day rather than over
 * the visible slice (`ui/views/calendar.js:572`), so the cell is still marked
 * and the count still invites the click. Banners at the top of a day is what
 * every calendar does, and the badge is what keeps that honest.
