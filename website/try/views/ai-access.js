/**
 * ui/views/ai-access.js — the panel where someone hands their mail to an AI.
 *
 * This is the most exposing screen in the app, so it is deliberately the least
 * convenient one. Four decisions drive everything below:
 *
 *  1. **It explains before it offers.** Every scope carries a sentence saying
 *     what that scope actually hands over, written as a fact rather than as
 *     reassurance. Someone who reads this page slowly should be able to say out
 *     loud what they allowed. If the copy here ever reads like marketing, it is
 *     wrong.
 *  2. **`mail.bodies` is not a checkbox.** It is the one choice that puts the
 *     full text of everything anyone has written to you on the other end of a
 *     socket, so it is a button that asks and a second button that confirms.
 *     Everything else on this page is a tick.
 *  3. **The server is the only source of truth.** All four routes —
 *     `GET/PUT /api/ai`, `POST /api/ai/tokens`, `DELETE /api/ai/tokens/:id` —
 *     answer with the same payload, so a change is applied by keeping the
 *     response, never by patching a local copy that could drift from what is on
 *     disk. In particular `effectiveScopes` is read rather than recomputed:
 *     `mail.bodies` grants mail headers, and the panel must show that without
 *     pretending the user ticked the headers box.
 *  4. **It degrades honestly.** If this build has no `/api/ai`, the panel says
 *     so in those words and still explains what each scope would hand over. It
 *     never renders a screen of controls that quietly do nothing.
 *
 * A note on state. The settings view re-renders wholesale whenever anything
 * bumps `state.rev` (see ui/app.js), which would rebuild this panel underneath
 * the user. The few things that must survive that — the fetched payload, a
 * minted token that will never be shown again, an open confirmation — live at
 * module scope rather than in the closure.
