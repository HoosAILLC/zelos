/**
 * core/sweep.mjs — the run loop.
 *
 * A sweep is: fetch every enabled source in parallel, persist what came back,
 * decide whether this run has to think, think if so, merge the result, and
 * record what happened. The two properties that matter more than speed:
 *
 *   ISOLATION. One dead IMAP host, one expired calendar URL, one account with
 *   no stored password — none of those may cost the user the rest of the run.
 *   Every source is fetched inside its own try/catch and reports its own
 *   outcome, and the run's `ok` reflects whether the run *worked*, not whether
 *   every source was reachable. A partial board beats an error page.
 *
 *   HONESTY ABOUT COST. A full run calls the model; a light run does not. The
 *   light/full decision is made from what is actually new, not from a timer, so
 *   a quiet afternoon costs nothing and a busy morning is re-thought.
 *
 * Nothing here ever acts on message or model content: text is fetched, stored,
 * rendered into a prompt and rendered into rows. No eval, no exec, no fetch of
 * anything a message asked for.

 * null and `/api/state` carrying no `tokens` at all, while the line the user
 * reads ("82k tokens in · 18k out") went on describing sweeps only. Ask is
 * spend, so it moves `tokensIn`/`tokensOut`; it is not a sweep and produced no
 * board, so it must move neither `runs` nor `modelRuns` — those two are what
 * "Zelos asked the model N times today" is counted from, and a question typed
 * into a panel is not a sweep that happened. Exported for the same reason it

 * first: `listBoard` asked for one bucket, so severity, then what is due soonest,
 * then longest-carried, exactly as the rail and the page already rank them. There
 * is one ranking in this product and this is not a second opinion on it.
 *
 * Nothing is ever deleted and no state is touched. An item that loses its place
 * moves to `today`, where it is still the user's work, still carried with its
 * first_seen intact, and still theirs to finish. Only open rows are considered:
 * a snoozed or finished item is a decision the user made, and demoting it would
 * be this pass overruling them to make room for the model.
 *
 * Exported because a sweep is not the only thing that can add to `now`: reading
 * the board wakes a snooze that has come due, and a fifth `now` item can arrive
 * that way with no sweep anywhere near it. core/server.mjs holds the bar on that
 * path with this same function, so there is one demotion rule and not two.

 * lets /api/ask through: an address and a model name, and either a local
 * runtime (keyless is normal there) or a stored key. It is asked here, on the
 * timer's path only, because `shouldRunFull` says "think" whenever no full run
 * has ever succeeded — which on a home with no model is forever — so a default
 * install that skipped setup otherwise ran a full sweep every interval, reached
 * `requireKey`, and wrote a failed run row each time with nothing to sweep and
 * nothing to ask. A hand-started sweep is deliberately not gated: a person who
 * asked gets the real error.
 *
 * The key is read through the `getSecret` seam rather than the secret store's
 * ref list so the check is injectable — the Scheduler tests never open a
 * keychain — and so a key pasted after launch is seen on the very next tick.
