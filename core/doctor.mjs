/**
 * core/doctor.mjs — "why isn't this working?", answered without a stack trace.
 *
 * `zelos doctor` is for the person who followed the instructions and got
 * nothing. Every check here ends in either "this is fine" or a sentence that
 * names the next thing to *do* — not the exception that was thrown. An error
 * message a user cannot act on is the same as no message at all.
 *
 * Three rules shape this file:
 *
 *  1. **It diagnoses; it does not repair.** The home-directory check reads the
 *     mode off disk *before* anything calls `paths()`, because `paths()`
 *     tightens the permissions as a side effect. A doctor that quietly fixes
 *     what it is measuring cannot tell you what was wrong.
 *  2. **It only talks to what you configured.** The model endpoint, your IMAP
 *     hosts and your calendar URLs — the same three outbound sockets the rest
 *     of Zelos is allowed. Nothing else, ever.
 *  3. **It never reads a secret out loud.** It reports whether a credential is
 *     *present*, never its value, and never puts one in a return value that a
 *     UI might render.
 *
 * `diagnose()` returns a plain JSON-safe report so the Settings screen can show
 * the same findings the terminal does.
