/**
 * core/sample-data.mjs — one believable week, entirely invented, easy to undo.
 *
 * The first run problem: a board with nothing on it teaches nobody anything, and
 * the only way to fill it is to hand over a mailbox password to software you have
 * not seen work yet. So this seeds a demo week into the *current* home — the same
 * database, the same views, no second profile to get lost in — and then removes
 * exactly what it put there.
 *
 * Two properties carry the whole thing:
 *
 *  1. **Marked.** Every row it writes starts with `SAMPLE_MARK`. There is no view
 *     in the app where sample data reads as real, because the mark is in the text
 *     the view renders, not in a flag the view might forget to check.
 *
 *  2. **Exactly reversible.** Seeding writes a manifest into `kv` listing the row
 *     ids it actually inserted — and it only records the ones where the insert was
 *     genuinely new, skipping anything that already existed. Clearing deletes that
 *     list and nothing else, which is why `rowCounts()` before and after is
 *     identical rather than approximately identical. `test/sample-data.test.mjs`
 *     asserts precisely that.
 *
 * The cast is fiction. Every person, firm and address below was made up for this
 * file, and every domain is under `.example`, the TLD RFC 2606 reserves so that it
 * can never resolve to anyone.
