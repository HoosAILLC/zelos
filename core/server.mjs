/**
 * core/server.mjs — the local HTTP server.
 *
 * This is the only process in Zelos that listens on a socket, and it listens
 * on 127.0.0.1 only. That is not enough on its own: **any web page the user has
 * open can send requests to 127.0.0.1**, and the browser will happily attach
 * them to whatever is listening there. So the security model here is not
 * decoration, it is the product:
 *
 *   1. A 32-byte hex session token is minted per launch and required on every
 *      /api/* request in the `X-Zelos-Token` header. Compared in constant
 *      time. A page that cannot read the token cannot reach the API — and it
 *      cannot read it, because we emit no CORS headers, ever.
 *   2. An `Origin` header that is present and is not this server's own origin
 *      is refused before the route runs. Cross-site form posts and fetches
 *      carry one; same-origin navigations do not.
 *   3. A `Host` header that is not a loopback name is refused. That is the
 *      DNS-rebinding case: attacker.example resolving to 127.0.0.1 so a page
 *      can talk to us "same-origin". The Host header still says attacker.example.
 *   4. Static files resolve against a fixed root and the resolved real path is
 *      asserted to be inside it, so `..`, `%2e%2e`, backslashes, overlong UTF-8
 *      and symlinks all fail before anything is read.
 *   5. Bodies are capped, so a runaway POST cannot exhaust memory.
 *
 * There is exactly one path that answers without the token, `GET /h/<id>`, and
 * it exists to hand the token over: a single-use, seconds-long address the
 * launcher opens a browser at so the token never has to travel on a command
 * line. It is subject to every check above, and see HandoffPad for why spending
 * one is not a way in for anything else.
 *
 * And one rule that outranks all of them: **no route ever returns a secret.**
 * /api/secrets is write-only — there is no read route, by design, not by
 * omission — and every config response is passed through a filter that drops
 * credential-shaped keys even though config.mjs already refuses to store them.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * `POST /api/mcp` (SPEC-v2 §1) is the one route that does not take the session
 * token. It takes a bearer token the user minted for a specific AI client, and
 * **only** that — the two credentials are not interchangeable in either
 * direction. A route that accepted either would be a CSRF hole with extra steps:
 * the session token is the thing a page in the browser is trying to get at, and
 * an AI token is a long-lived credential that has no business reaching the rest
 * of the API. So the session gate below returns 401 for an AI token, and the MCP
 * gate ignores `X-Zelos-Token` entirely. Everything else — loopback binding, the
 * Host check, the Origin check, no CORS — applies to /api/mcp unchanged, which
 * is why a web page cannot reach it even holding a stolen bearer token.

 * other process on the machine for as long as the opener runs. A handoff id may
 * sit in an argument vector safely, because by the time anyone could read it
 * there it has already been spent and means nothing.
 *
 * What makes that true is enforced here rather than promised:
 *
 *   - **Once.** The entry is removed before the token is written, so two
 *     requests racing for the same id cannot both be answered. A browser that
 *     preloads the address and then loads it again gets the token once and a
 *     dead link the second time, which is the correct and slightly annoying
 *     behaviour of a one-time credential.
 *   - **Briefly.** Expiry is checked on every look, so an id that was never
 *     spent stops working whether or not anything asks about it again.
 *   - **Unguessably.** 32 bytes from the CSPRNG, compared in constant time
 *     against every live entry with no early exit, so neither the value nor the
 *     number of live handoffs is readable from how long a refusal took.
 *
 * It weakens nothing about the per-launch token model: a handoff yields that
 * launch's session token and nothing else, it dies with the process along with
 * the token itself, and it is reached through the same Host and Origin checks as
 * every other path on this server.
