/**
 * core/home-lock.mjs — the exclusion on the data home.
 *
 * Electron's `requestSingleInstanceLock` only stops a second *Electron* app.
 * It knows nothing about `zelos` run from a terminal, and that is the pairing
 * people actually end up in: the shell in the tray, a CLI in a window, both
 * pointed at `~/.zelos`. Two schedulers then sweep one WAL database on their
 * own clocks — the same mail fetched twice, the same model calls paid for
 * twice, the same drafts written twice, and two boards each convinced its
 * `sweeps` supervisor is the only one running. Nothing crashes, which is what
 * makes it expensive.
 *
 * So the exclusion is on the thing that is actually shared: the home directory.
 * A `zelos.lock` file there carries the pid, what kind of Zelos it is, and the
 * port once one is bound, and it is created with link(2) against a unique temp
 * file — the one filesystem operation that both fails when the target exists
 * and publishes the whole record at once, so a reader never sees half of it.
 *
 * **Why this lives in `core/` and not beside the Electron shell.** It was
 * written for the shell and lived in `desktop/runtime.js`, which made the whole
 * feature dead in the published package: `package.json`'s `files` list ships
 * `core/`, `ui/`, `assets/` and `zelos.mjs`, and deliberately does not ship
 * `desktop/` — the Electron shell is a separate artefact and `test/cli.test.mjs`
 * asserts the tarball is free of it. So `zelos.mjs`'s `await import('./desktop/
 * runtime.js')` threw ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND into a bare catch on every installed
 * copy, and the exclusion existed only for people running from a git checkout.
 * Measured on the packed tarball: no `zelos.lock` was ever written, and a second
 * process against a home a live one already held started a second scheduler
 * with no warning at all. This module imports nothing but node builtins, so
 * there was never a reason for it to sit on the Electron side of the line.
 *
 * A lock that outlives its owner would be worse than no lock, because the way
 * out of it is a file the user has never heard of. So a lock whose holder is
 * gone is not a lock: it is reclaimed, silently, on the next start. Staleness
 * has to be *decidable*, though, and `kill(pid, 0)` on its own cannot decide
 * it — a recycled pid now belonging to a root daemon answers `EPERM`, which
 * read as "alive" is a refusal no reboot and no amount of quitting will ever
 * clear. So the record carries what it takes to tell:
 *
 *   - `startedAt`. A lock written before this machine last booted cannot be
 *     held by anything, whatever the pid now answers. `os.uptime()` is where
 *     the boot instant comes from, with slack for a clock that moved.
 *   - `uid`. A process this user started is always signallable by this user, so
 *     `EPERM` against a record written by this same uid is proof of pid reuse
 *     rather than of life. Only a record naming a *different* uid — a Zelos run
 *     under sudo, say — is allowed to be alive-but-unsignallable.
 *   - An age ceiling on that last case, because it is the one branch left that
 *     no other evidence can settle, and a month-old lock nobody can probe is a
 *     lockout rather than a lock.
 *
 * And whatever it decides, the refusal names the file, so there is always a way
 * out that does not require knowing any of this.

 * Take the lock, and never refuse to start over it.

 * This began as an exclusion — a live holder threw, and the caller stopped —

 * rules read wrong, and a user who could not start their own app because of a
 * file they had never heard of. A stale pid across a reboot. A pid recycled
 * onto a root daemon. A home on a filesystem with no link(2). Each was fixable,
 * and the next one was always going to be findable, because the failure mode of
 * "refuse" is unbounded: every bug in it costs the user the product.
 *
 * So the lock ADVISES. A contested home comes back as a handle with `contested`
 * set, naming who appears to hold it, and the caller decides what to do about
 * it — the desktop shell asks the person, the launcher prints a warning and
 * carries on. The worst a wrong answer can now do is show a warning that was
 * not needed, which is a cost the user can see and dismiss. What it protects
 * against is real but survivable: two schedulers sweeping one database, paying
 * for the same model calls twice. Telling someone that is happening gets almost
 * all of the value; refusing to run gets the rest of it and risks everything.
 *
 * The returned handle has `setPort`, called once the server has bound, so the
 * warning the *next* process shows can name a URL rather than only a pid.
 * `release()` unlinks only a lock this process still owns: a reclaim race would
 * otherwise let a departing instance take the live one's lock away with it.
 * A filesystem that cannot do an exclusive create comes back `degraded`.
