/**
 * core/help.mjs — "Ask Claude to walk me through this."
 *
 * A person stuck on a setup screen can hand that screen to Claude (or
 * ChatGPT) in their own browser. What they hand over is a message this file
 * writes: which screen they are on, what that screen shows, the real steps
 * at their email provider, and how to help a person who has never heard of
 * a protocol. The app opens `https://claude.ai/new?q=<the message>`, so the
 * chat starts already knowing everything Zelos knows about the step — and
 * nothing about the person.
 *
 * That last clause is the rule this file exists to keep. The message may
 * name the step, the provider (Gmail, iCloud, Outlook…), the computer (Mac,
 * Windows, Linux) and Zelos's own public pages. It must never carry the
 * person's email address, a key, a password, a file path under their home,
 * or anything read from their mail. So the inputs are closed lists — an
 * unrecognised provider becomes "unknown", an unrecognised step is refused —
 * and test/help.test.mjs reads every message this file can write and hunts
 * for an address, a key prefix, a home path.
 *
 * Pure. No I/O, no clock, no config: the same arguments give the same
 * message, which is what lets the whole space of messages be tested.
 *
 * The words on the screens are quoted from ui/views/onboarding.js and
 * ui/views/settings.js — "Pick the AI that reads your mail", "Check it
 * works", "Get an app password", "Server settings (for experts)" — so that
 * what Claude tells the person to press is what is on their screen. The
 * provider pages are the ones the app itself links: the app-password pages
 * from core/sources/imap.mjs's provider table (through `describeProvider`,
 * which is that table's public face) and the calendar pages from
 * core/server.mjs's GUIDES, handed in by the route rather than imported,
 * because server.mjs imports this file and a module that imports its own
 * importer is a thing to explain forever.
