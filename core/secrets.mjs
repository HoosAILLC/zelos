/**
 * core/secrets.mjs — the only place a credential is allowed to exist.
 *
 * Zelos stores IMAP passwords and model API keys. config.json holds a `keyRef`
 * ("model.default", "mail.m_9f3a1c"); the value behind that ref lives here.
 *
 * Three properties this module is responsible for, in order of importance:
 *
 *  1. **A secret never appears in argv.** `ps` shows every process's command line
 *     to every other process running as this user. `describeCommand()` — the one
 *     function that builds a command line — takes no value parameter at all, so
 *     it is structurally incapable of leaking one. Values travel on stdin.
 *  2. **A secret never lands on disk in plaintext.** Platform keychain first;
 *     the fallback file is AES-256-GCM.
 *  3. **There is no way to enumerate values.** `listRefs()` returns refs. There
 *     is deliberately no `listSecrets`, and the HTTP layer has no read route.
 *
 * Backend order per SPEC §2: macOS keychain, Windows DPAPI, libsecret, then the
 * encrypted-file fallback. Set ZELOS_SECRETS_BACKEND to force one (used by the
 * tests to exercise the fallback on a machine that has a keychain).
 *
 * Detection runs once and is then *pinned*: the first successful write records
 * the store in `secrets.backend.json`, and from then on that record beats the
 * probe — see "the backend on record" below for why a probe that changes its
 * mind is how a user's credentials end up in two places at once.

/* -------------------------------------------------------------- timeouts
 * One number served every subprocess this module runs — a liveness check, a
 * "does this ref still exist", and the write that carries a password — and it
 * was too small for the ones that can lose something.
 *
 * `run()` defaulted to 15_000 ms and the PowerShell probe passed 15_000
 * explicitly, so a liveness check and the write that carries a user's IMAP
 * password were handed the same budget. Two measurements say that is wrong in
 * both directions.
 *
 * (1) A GitHub Actions `windows-latest` runner — fast, idle, nothing else on
 *     it — failed a release build:
 *
 *       ✖ Windows CI: DPAPI is the detected backend and really round-trips a
 *         secret (18136ms)
 *         Error: powershell.exe timed out after 15000ms
 *
 *     It passed on re-run, which is the point. That is not a broken machine;
 *     it is a machine that was slower than a number somebody picked, once.
 *
 *     Which of that test's PowerShell spawns died is not in the output, but it
 *     is derivable, and the derivation is the useful half. The probe SWALLOWS a
 *     timeout and answers false, so a probe that blew the budget would have
 *     failed the test on its `assert.equal(b.name, 'windows-dpapi')` line
 *     rather than escaping as an Error; only setSecret/getSecret/deleteSecret
 *     let one out. So on that machine, at that moment: everything up to and
 *     including the cold probe fitted inside 18_136 − 15_000 = 3_136 ms, and
 *     the very next spawn — the one that autoloads
 *     Microsoft.PowerShell.Security for ConvertFrom-SecureString and writes a
 *     new file through whatever filter drivers are installed — was SIGKILLed at
 *     15_000 ms with work left to do.
 *
 *     A liveness probe and a credential access are not the same size. On one
 *     machine at one moment they differed by a factor of at least 4.8, and one
 *     constant was flattening that.
 *
 * (2) `listRefs()` returned `[]` after 15_020 ms. Those 20 ms of slack over the
 *     probe's own 15_000 are the whole story: the probe timed out, reported "no
 *     PowerShell on this machine", detection fell through to encrypted-file,
 *     and an empty secrets.enc answered that this home has no credentials at
 *     all. Nothing was lost, and nothing said anything — which is the exact
 *     conflation the longest comment in this file warns about, arriving through
 *     the one door that comment did not watch.
 *
 * Where the numbers come from, and why they are not round
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 * 3_136 ms is an UPPER bound on a cold `powershell.exe` on the reference
 * runner: the probe is inside it, but so is the test's own setup. 15_000 ms is
 * not a measurement of how long an access takes — it is how long one was
 * allowed to run before it was killed. The real requirement is unknown, because
 * the kill destroyed the evidence, so it can only be treated as a floor already
 * proved too small on the FASTEST, least contended machine in the fleet. A
 * user's laptop, cold, under load, with an antivirus scanning the spawn and
 * every assembly it maps, is the machine these budgets are actually for.
 *
 * So each budget is derived from one of those two, and its factor says what it
 * is buying:
 *
 *   probe  = 3_136 × 2  =  6_272 ms   headroom for a machine twice as slow as
 *                                     the reference runner, on the cold attempt
 *   access = 15_000 × 4 = 60_000 ms   four times a floor that was already too
 *                                     small on an idle CI box
 *
 * The probe getting SHORTER is not a typo. Two attempts at 6_272 ms is 12_544
 * ms of worst-case wall clock — less than the single 15_000 ms budget it
 * replaces — and it now survives cases the old one failed, because of the two
 * changes below: a timeout is retried, and a timeout no longer reads as "this
 * store is not on this machine".
 *
 * Neither number is what is expected to save a slow machine. The retry is.

/* -------------------------------------------------- the backend on record
 * A probe is a guess about this instant, and it decided where every credential
 * for the rest of the process went — `backend()` caches under
 * `platform|env|home`, with no probe result in the key, so nothing could revise
 * it. One 8-second timeout, one spawn refused by a sandbox, one secret-tool
 * losing its race with the keyring daemon at session start, and a password
 * typed that afternoon landed in `secrets.enc` — a file the docs tell users is
 * "only present if your system has no keychain". The next launch probed
 * successfully, went back to the keychain, and read the OLD value out of it:
 * a rotated password silently ignored, authentication failing for a reason
 * nothing on screen could explain.
 *
 * So the store a home actually committed to is written down at the first
 * successful setSecret, and from then on the record beats the probe. A
 * disagreement now surfaces as a real error from the tool that is missing
 * ("could not read model.default from macos-keychain") instead of a quiet move
 * to a second store. Two deliberate exceptions:
 *
 *  - ZELOS_SECRETS_BACKEND still wins outright. That is a person saying it on
 *    purpose, and it is how the tests reach the fallback on a machine with a
 *    keychain. It does NOT move the record: `recordBackend` leaves a usable
 *    record alone, so a forced run over a home that has already committed puts
 *    the value somewhere a later unforced run will not look. That is the price
 *    of "the first store to hold a secret wins", and it is deliberate — an
 *    override is not evidence about where the rest of this home's credentials
 *    are. It is not left silent either: `core/doctor.mjs:405-414` reads this
 *    same record, notices the override, and says in as many words that
 *    anything saved while it is set lands elsewhere and will not be found
 *    without it. (An earlier version of this comment claimed the record *was*
 *    updated. It never was, and doctor's text was the honest one.)
 *  - A record naming a backend that cannot exist on this platform is ignored:
 *    that is a home copied from another machine, which is a migration rather
 *    than a flaky probe.
