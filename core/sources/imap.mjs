/**
 * core/sources/imap.mjs — IMAP4rev1, from the socket up.
 *
 * The whole reason this file exists instead of an npm install: Zelos claims
 * that nothing about your mail leaves your machine, and that claim is only
 * worth something if every byte of the mail path is auditable in this repo.
 *
 * Three decisions carry the correctness of the module:
 *
 *  1. The wire is parsed as BYTES with an explicit literal-length state, never
 *     by splitting on CRLF. `{123}\r\n` means "the next 123 bytes are opaque",
 *     and those bytes routinely contain CRLF, ")" and quotes. A line splitter
 *     appears to work until someone sends you a subject with a paren in it.
 *  2. Reads never mutate the mailbox. `EXAMINE` instead of `SELECT`, and
 *     `BODY.PEEK[...]` instead of `BODY[...]` — a `BODY[` fetch sets \Seen, and
 *     silently marking somebody's mail as read is not a bug you get to ship.
 *     `fetch()` refuses to send one.
 *  3. UIDs only. Sequence numbers are renumbered by any expunge, including one
 *     that happens between two of our own commands.
 *
 * Section 6 is the fourth decision and the newest: some providers no longer
 * accept a password at all, so the client speaks `AUTHENTICATE XOAUTH2` as well
 * as LOGIN and PLAIN, and the bearer token it needs is minted here by an OAuth
 * device authorization grant against a registration the USER owns. Nothing else
 * about the client changes — the mechanism is chosen by config in one branch of
 * `login()`, and every other byte of the session is the same session.

 * empty. So a server that sends nothing but well-formed, complete untagged
 * lines never trips either of them — it hands them off, one at a time, to
 * `#current.untagged`, which had no cap at all. That array only empties when
 * the tagged completion arrives, and a hostile server simply never sends one.
 *
 * This is the same reported harm as the `{0}` flood and needs the same absence
 * of credentials: measured against the real client with the real socket, a
 * server answering the pre-auth CAPABILITY with `* OK <1 KB>\r\n` forever took
 * rss from 231 MB to 491 MB in 1.6 s and then a fatal V8 out-of-memory, with
 * both assembler caps quiet throughout because no single response was ever
 * large or ever had many pieces. `#onData` re-arms the idle timer on every
 * chunk, so the 30 s deadline never helps here either.
 *
 * Counted two ways for the same reason the assembler counts two ways — a
 * response costs far more heap than its own text. Measured retained cost of a
 * parsed untagged response: 372 bytes for a 5-character one, 503 for 65
 * characters, 1,451 for 1,005. Bytes alone would let sixteen million six-byte
 * responses through before noticing.
 *
 * 50,000 responses is two orders of magnitude past the largest real command —
 * `fetch()` chunks at 100 UIDs, so a FETCH yields ~100, and `LIST "" "*"` one
 * per mailbox — and the byte ceiling is the same 96 MB the assembler already
 * allows a single response, so "one command may buffer 96 MB" holds however
 * the server chooses to slice it.

   * `requireTls` is the answer to a silent failure mode. With `secure: false`
   * the client offers to upgrade, but only if the server says it can — and a
   * machine in the middle can simply delete STARTTLS from the capability list,
   * at which point the client shrugs and sends the password in the clear. The
   * user is told nothing, because from the client's side nothing went wrong.
   *
   * So the requirement is stated, not inferred from what the server offered:
   * `true` refuses to authenticate over anything but a real TLS socket, `false`
   * permits cleartext, and `null` (or nothing at all, which is what every
   * existing config says) means "required unless the host is loopback".
   *
   * `signal` is the other half of Ctrl-C. The idle timer is a deadline for
   * SILENCE and nothing else — `#onData` re-arms it on every chunk — so a
   * server that keeps talking without ever completing the command is unbounded
   * in time, and even a silent one costs the full `timeoutMs`. Neither is a
   * cancellation: the user has already said stop. An abort fails the command in
   * flight and destroys the socket, which is what makes the stop visible in the
   * same second it was asked for.
   *
   * `accessToken` and `auth` are the OAuth seam, and they are the whole of it:
   * an account that carries a bearer token authenticates with `AUTHENTICATE
   * XOAUTH2` instead of a password and every other byte of the session is
   * unchanged. See `resolveAuthMethod` for why the choice is named rather than
   * guessed from whether a token happens to be present.

 * `"pa\"ss\\word"` and a server quoting the LOGIN line it rejected hands back a
 * string that `includes(pass)` says nothing about. That escaped form — with and
 * without its quotes — is listed here alongside the verbatim bytes, the
 * standalone base64, and the SASL PLAIN payload `base64(NUL user NUL pass)`.
 *
 * Two traps, both of which this used to walk into, and both of which are only
 * visible end to end through `testConnection` against a server that echoes the
 * line it rejected:
 *
 *  1. The list is not five distinct strings. A password with no `"` and no `\`
 *     escapes to itself, so `pass === escaped` and the same needle appeared
 *     twice — hence the `Set`.
 *  2. Substituting one form at a time re-scans text that has already been
 *     redacted, and `<password withheld>` is not inert: it contains "pass",
 *     "word", "password" and "withheld". Measured through the real
 *     `testConnection`, the password `pass` came back as
 *     `<<<password withheld>word withheld>word withheld>` and `word` as
 *     `<pass<pass<password withheld> withheld> withheld>`. Nothing leaked —
 *     each pass ate the marker, not the secret — but the diagnosis the user
 *     needs was shredded by the very code meant to preserve it.
 *
 * So: one left-to-right pass over the original text, longest form first at any
 * given offset, and the cursor jumps past what was struck. Output is never an
 * input, which is what makes the result independent of the order of the list.
 *
 * A server that echoes any of these forms is handing the credential back, and
 * everything downstream — the Settings "Test connection" response body,
 * `runs.stats_json` on disk, /api/state, a log line — would keep it.
 *
 * `accessToken` joined the list when XOAUTH2 did, and it is not a nicety. A
 * bearer token is a bigger credential than the password it replaces — it is
 * mail access for the next hour with no second factor in front of it — and it
 * travels in exactly two shapes: verbatim (the challenge a server writes back)
 * and inside `base64(user=…^Aauth=Bearer <token>^A^A)` (the SASL blob a server
 * quoting the line it rejected hands straight back). Both are listed, because
 * an XOAUTH2 `NO` lands in `sources[].error` by the same route a LOGIN one does.

 * Microsoft switched basic authentication off for personal Outlook, Hotmail,

 * there is no password of any kind that opens an IMAP session on those accounts
 * any more. Zelos went on offering `outlook.office365.com` as a preset with no
 * caveat next to it, so the shipped path for one of the two largest consumer
 * mail providers was an authentication failure in the middle of onboarding,
 * with nothing anywhere saying why. `AUTHENTICATE XOAUTH2` is the way back in
 * and a bearer token is the only thing it accepts.
 *
 * Which OAuth flow is not a preference. Zelos ships NO client id of its own: one
 * we published would need Microsoft publisher verification (a Partner One ID and
 * a verified domain), and it would make every install's mail access contingent
 * on an app registration this project holds and could lose. So the credential is
 * a thing the USER mints in their own account and pastes in, like every other
 * credential in this app — which rules out a client secret (there is nowhere to
 * keep one) and rules out a redirect URI (a desktop app with no inbound port
 * cannot receive a callback, and RFC 8252's loopback receiver needs the
 * registration to name the port range). What is left is RFC 8628: the program
 * shows a code, the user types it into a browser they already trust, and the
 * program polls. It was designed for televisions and printers, and a mail
 * client that refuses to run a web server is the same shape of problem.
 *
 * Everything here is inert without a registration: no client id, no request.
