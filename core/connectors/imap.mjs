/**
 * core/connectors/imap.mjs — a mailbox, read over IMAP.
 *
 * The protocol lives in core/sources/imap.mjs (1,643 lines behind 1,507 lines of
 * tests) and none of it moved. What moved here is the three functions between
 * the protocol and the sweep — which mailboxes to read, which direction a
 * message went, and the reader the sweep's `deps.fetchMail` seam defaults to —
 * because all three are IMAP semantics that the run loop happened to be
 * holding.
 *
 * `fields` is deliberately empty. A mail account is edited by `mailForm` in
 * ui/views/settings.js, and genericising that form would cost the three-way TLS
 * selector, the SPECIAL-USE sent-folder reader and the `identity.email`
 * adoption — three behaviours with tests and a written history. A field schema
 * that cannot express them would not be a description of this connector; it
 * would be a worse editor for it.

 *

/**
 * The default mail reader: one IMAP connection per mailbox.
 *
 * `signal` is forwarded, and that is the half of Ctrl-C that used to be missing.
 * The caller's check between mailboxes only ever caught a sweep between reads;
 * a read already on the wire ran to its own end, so the first Ctrl-C did
 * nothing a user could see and what actually ended the process was the
 * launcher's 5 s escape timer — a force-exit, not a stop. `fetchRecent` now
 * hands the signal to the client, which fails the command in flight and
 * destroys the socket, so `abort()` in the run loop is reached with the
 * connection already closed rather than still reading.
 *
 * `requireTls` is forwarded deliberately, and `?? null` rather than `|| null`,
 * because the setting is three-valued: `false` is a standing permission to talk
 * to this one host in the clear, and collapsing it into "not set" would put the
 * requirement back on a Proton Bridge the user has already excused. An account
 * saved before the field existed has no value at all, which is what `null`
 * means — the client then decides from the host, as it always has.
 *
 * `auth` and `oauth` are forwarded for a blunter reason: without them the sweep
 * signed in with a password whatever the config said. `AUTHENTICATE XOAUTH2` and
 * the device grant were implemented and tested in core/sources/imap.mjs, and
 * `fetchRecent` grew both parameters — and this function, the only production
 * caller, passed neither. `resolveAuthMethod(null, '')` is `'password'`, so a
 * hand-edited `auth: 'xoauth2'` account validated cleanly, showed as configured,
 * and then sent a password that Microsoft has not accepted since 16 September
 * 2024. A half-wired contract that is already user-visible is worse than one
 * nobody started.
