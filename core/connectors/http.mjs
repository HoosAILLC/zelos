/**
 * core/connectors/http.mjs — the only way out to the network a connector gets.
 *
 * Three hand-rolled HTTP readers already exist in this repo — core/sweep.mjs's
 * `fetchIcsText`, core/server.mjs's calendar probe, core/doctor.mjs's redirect
 * follower — and each carries its own copy of the same paragraph: that
 * `redirect: 'follow'` means twenty hops on undici, and that a measured
 * 22-origin chain contacted twenty-one hosts before anything noticed. Writing
 * that paragraph a fourth time for GitHub, a fifth for Linear and a sixth for
 * Slack is how the claim in docs/SECURITY.md — that you can watch Zelos with
 * tcpdump and see only what you configured — stops being true.
 *
 * So it is written once, here, and a connector cannot opt out: `ctx.http` is
 * the object it is handed, `fetch` is not in scope for it, and a repo test
 * greps core/connectors/ for a bare `fetch(` and fails on a hit. Everything
 * below is enforcement, not convenience:
 *
 *   1. ORIGIN ALLOW-LIST. A URL that is not on the connector's declared
 *      `origins`, or on the origin of a `type: 'url'` field the user filled in
 *      themselves, is refused before a socket exists. That is the whole SSRF
 *      story: a URL that arrived inside a payload — a feed's <link>, an issue
 *      body, a redirect target — is not fetchable, and it costs one array.
 *   2. ONE REDIRECT HOP, and the credential is re-sent only when the
 *      destination is the same origin. The same rule `fetchIcsText` already
 *      applies to a calendar password.
 *   3. A BYTE CAP read off the stream rather than off `content-length`, because
 *      a server that wants to hand Zelos 48 MiB will not announce it. See
 *      core/sweep.mjs's ERROR_CHARS for what a stranger's server is capable of
 *      putting in a single field.
 *   4. ONE DEADLINE covering both hops, composed with the sweep's own abort
 *      signal, so a redirect cannot buy a second full timeout.
 *   5. THE RATE NUMBERS from the manifest — the gap between two requests, and a
 *      persisted rolling budget — plus `Retry-After` when the server states one,
 *      because a declared budget is a guess and the header is the fact.
 *   6. CREDENTIAL ATTACHMENT from `credential.send`. The connector never writes
 *      an `Authorization` header and *cannot* put a token in a query string:
 *      there is no `as: 'query'`. core/log.mjs redacts `authorization` by key
 *      name and `Bearer …` by shape, but `?token=…` inside a URL is logged
 *      intact by anything that logs a URL — ours, the vendor's, and every proxy
 *      in between. Removing the option is cheaper than auditing for it.
