/**
 * core/connectors/fireflies.mjs — meeting recaps from Fireflies.ai.
 *
 * The one notetaker with a free, self-serve API: the user mints an API key in
 * their own account and pastes it in. There is no OAuth app, no client id, no
 * secret of ours, and no inbound port — which is the only kind of integration
 * this product is allowed to have.
 *
 * Three things in here are not style, and each of them has already cost
 * somebody something.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 1. THE FREE TIER IS FIFTY REQUESTS A DAY, SO THE DOCUMENT IS THE DESIGN.
 *
 * The obvious way to write this connector is the wrong one:
 *
 *     transcripts { id }                       -> 1 request
 *     transcript(id: $id) { summary { … } }    -> one request PER MEETING
 *
 * That is 1 + N. An hourly poll on a day with four meetings is 24 + 96 = 120
 * requests against an allowance of 50, so the connector would stop working
 * before lunch on the first busy day and the user would be told "rate limited"
 * about a source they poll once an hour. GraphQL exists precisely so that does
 * not have to happen: `transcripts` returns whole `Transcript` objects, so the
 * nested `summary` — the overview and the action items, the entire reason this
 * row is worth having — comes back inside the SAME response as the list.
 *
 * So MEETINGS_QUERY below asks for everything in one round trip, and `collect`
 * makes exactly ONE `postJson` call. Twenty-four polls a day cost twenty-four
 * requests, which fits in fifty with room for `zelos doctor`. There is
 * deliberately no pagination loop: a second page is a second request out of
 * fifty, and an hour of a person's life does not contain fifty meetings.
 *
 * The document names three arguments — `fromDate`, `toDate`, `limit` — and no
 * more, on purpose. Every extra argument and every extra selected field is a
 * name that has to exist in the vendor's schema, and a GraphQL server rejects
 * the WHOLE document over one unknown field. A filter that would be nice to
 * have is not worth a connector that returns nothing for everyone the week the
 * vendor renames something.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 2. A 200 WITH AN `errors` ARRAY IS A FAILURE. THIS REPO HAS BEEN BITTEN.
 *
 * GraphQL states failures in the body, not in the status line: a bad key, a
 * spent allowance and a mistyped field all arrive as HTTP 200. `ctx.http` can
 * only see the status, so it hands that body back as a success, and the naive
 * reader does `json.data.transcripts ?? []` and returns an empty array — which
 * reads as "you had no meetings" for a source that is in fact broken.
 *
 * core/llm.mjs:906-956 is the same defect, already paid for: OpenRouter answers
 * a billing problem with 200 and "402: insufficient credits" in the envelope,
 * it was read as a success that is an empty string, Settings painted the broken
 * endpoint green, and the sweep then told the user their model was too small
 * and to buy a bigger one — for a topped-out account. The comment there ends
 * "which half you happened to call must not decide whether you are told."
 *
 * `parseGraphql` below is the answer for this half. Any non-empty `errors`
 * array throws, whether or not `data` also came back populated, and a body with
 * neither meetings nor an error throws too — because that third shape is the
 * same lie wearing a different hat.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 3. AN AUTH FAILURE THAT ARRIVES AS 200 HAS TO BE PROMOTED HERE.
 *
 * core/sweep.mjs:402-409 rests a source for six hours on an `AuthError` and
 * says why: "Retrying a 401 against a host that allows fifty calls a day burns
 * forty-eight of them before lunch." That is this host, and that is this
 * allowance — but core/connectors/http.mjs only raises `AuthError` on a 401 or
 * 403, and Fireflies rejects a bad key with 200 and a message in `errors`. The
 * transport can never see it. So `graphqlError` classifies the body and raises
 * `AuthError` and `RateLimitError` itself; without that, a key the user revoked
 * would cost twenty-four wasted requests a day, every day, silently.

 * `floor(room / entries)` when the prompt does not fit, and `clean()` at :482
 * caps from the TAIL — so on a busy day the bottom of every body is what the
 * model never sees. An overview runs to thousands of characters and the action
 * items run to a few hundred; putting the overview first would mean the one
 * part that makes this a thing you owe is the first part cut. They are in the
 * snippet for the same reason: core/triage.mjs:544 renders the snippet at every
 * level except `bare`, and the board shows it directly.
 *
 * `date` FALLS BACK TO THE READ INSTANT, AND OMITTING IT IS NOT AN OPTION.
 * `meetingDate` returns null when neither `dateString` nor `date` came back in a
 * shape that parses — a vendor release that populates only one of them, an empty
 * string, an epoch of 0 — and a null lands in `messages.sent_at` as NULL.
 * core/db.mjs:441 filters the prompt with `sent_at >= ?` and SQLite evaluates
 * `NULL >= '2026-07-21…'` to NULL, which is not true, so the row is dropped from
 * `gatherPromptInput` (core/sweep.mjs:1115) — the only read that reaches the
 * model and the board. Measured against a real database: two rows upserted, two
 * rows stored, ONE row returned to the prompt. The poll still says "1 meeting",
 * `stats.newMessages` still counts it, `zelos doctor` still passes, and the
 * meeting is invisible. That is the worst failure this connector has, because
 * nothing anywhere says it happened.
 *
 * core/connectors/linear.mjs:55-57 already names the rule — "Omitting `date`
 * entirely is not an option either — `sent_at` would be NULL and `NULL >= ?` is
 * NULL, so the row is dropped from the prompt just as silently" — and
 * core/connectors/folder.mjs:439-445 already implements the other half of it, by
 * falling back to the file's mtime rather than to nothing. So the fallback here
 * is the read instant: it buys INCLUSION in the window, which is the whole of
 * what is at stake. It does not pretend to be the meeting time — the transcript
 * link in the body is one click from the real one — and `collect` deliberately
 * does NOT let it move the cursor.
 *
 * THERE IS NO `uid` KEY HERE AND THERE MUST NEVER BE ONE. core/db.mjs:384 reads
 * `Number.isFinite(Number(uid)) ? Number(uid) : null`, so `uid: null` becomes 0
 * while an OMITTED uid stays null — two different `messageRowId`s for the same
 * meeting (58ac70ac2a9131aa against 36c5d228c13041e4, measured in
 * core/sweep.mjs:411-422). A release that flipped between them would re-insert
 * every recap it has ever seen, on every sweep, forever: `stats.newMessages`
 * would never settle, `shouldRunFull` would force a full run each time, and the
 * user would be billed for a model call every thirty minutes. A meeting has no
 * integer identity, so this connector never mentions the field.
