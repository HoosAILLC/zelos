/**
 * core/connectors/rss.mjs — an RSS or Atom feed.
 *
 * This is the connector written to prove the interface, and it was chosen
 * because it needs no credential and no vendor account: the whole of it can be
 * exercised against a local HTTP server with no secret store involved. If the
 * contract were awkward for a source this plain, it would be wrong.
 *
 * Three things it demonstrates that a mail account cannot:
 *
 *  - THE CURSOR IS OPAQUE, and here it is HTTP's own incremental mechanism.
 *    `ETag` and `Last-Modified` come back as `If-None-Match` and
 *    `If-Modified-Since`, and a 304 is a successful read of nothing. Zelos never
 *    looks inside the value; it stores what it was handed and hands it back.
 *  - A ROW WITHOUT A `uid`. core/db.mjs:384 reads `Number.isFinite(Number(uid))
 *    ? Number(uid) : null`, so `uid: null` becomes 0 and an OMITTED uid becomes
 *    null — two different row ids for the same entry (36c5d228c13041e4 against
 *    58ac70ac2a9131aa, measured). A connector that emits `uid: null` on one
 *    release and omits it on the next re-inserts every row it has ever seen, on
 *    every sweep, forever. There is no `uid` key anywhere below and there must
 *    never be one: a feed entry has no integer identity.
 *  - `sink: 'messages'` FOR SOMETHING THAT IS NOT MAIL. `source_id` and `folder`
 *    are free text and `from_email` is never validated as an address, so an
 *    article is a message that arrived from a publication — which is exactly
 *    how the board should read it. The record types are named for how the board
 *    reads a thing, not for the vendor's noun.
 *
 * The parser is deliberately small and deliberately not a parser. A feed is a
 * stranger's XML; the only questions asked of it are "which elements are items"
 * and "what text is inside this one", and both are answered by scanning rather
 * than by building a tree. Nothing here evaluates, resolves an entity file, or
 * follows a URL the document names — `ctx.http` would refuse the last one
 * anyway, which is the point of the allow-list.

    /* AN ENTRY WITH NO DATE IS STILL DATED, AND THE DATE MUST NOT MOVE.
       `pubDate` is optional in RSS 2.0 and hand-rolled feeds leave it out; a
       `date: null` lands in `messages.sent_at` as NULL, and core/db.mjs:441
       filters the prompt with `sent_at >= ?`, which SQLite evaluates to NULL
       for a NULL row. So the entry was stored, counted as new, reported ok with
       a count — and never once reached the model or the board. The same
       failure fireflies.mjs had (fab9f6f), with the same half of the cure: fall
       back to an instant that buys inclusion in the window.

       WHICH instant is where this differs from Fireflies. core/db.mjs's upsert
       sets `sent_at = excluded.sent_at` unconditionally, and a feed is
       re-parsed whole on every 200 — so `|| readAt` alone would re-date every
       dateless entry to "now" each time anything in the feed changed, and a
       month-old post would walk back into the seven-day prompt window as
       today's, every time its neighbours moved. The instant is therefore chosen
       ONCE, the first time the entry is seen, and the cursor remembers it under
       a hash of the entry's identity: the channel's own date first
       (`<lastBuildDate>`, Atom's feed-level `<updated>` — the publisher's own
       claim about when this feed was built, and the entry was in it), then the
       instant of this read. Both go through `parseDate` so the stored form is
       the one a parsed `<pubDate>` has; core/db.mjs orders `sent_at` as text,
       and folder.mjs:424 already paid for learning that `+00:00` and `Z` sort
       apart.

       The memory is bounded at SEEN_MAX because core/sweep.mjs refuses a
       cursor over 4 KB OUTRIGHT — validators and all — and it is keyed by
       identity rather than position so an entry keeps its instant as the feed
       reorders. Dateless entries past the bound are dated afresh on each
       parse, which is the old behaviour minus the NULL; entries that leave the
       feed leave the memory with them. The cursor is not moved by any of this
       — there is no high-water mark here to move — so the Fireflies hazard of
       an invented instant dragging the window forward does not arise. */
