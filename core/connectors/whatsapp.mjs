/**
 * core/connectors/whatsapp.mjs — a WhatsApp conversation the user exported
 * themselves.
 *
 * ========================================================================
 * WHY THIS IS A FILE READER AND NOT AN INTEGRATION
 * ========================================================================
 *
 * Every other connector in this directory polls something. This one does not,
 * and the reason is not that nobody got round to it. There are exactly three
 * ways to get at a personal WhatsApp account's messages, and two of them are
 * not available to this product at any price:
 *
 *  1. THE WHATSAPP BUSINESS CLOUD API. It is business-to-customer messaging and
 *     it HAS NO READ ENDPOINT AT ALL — there is no "list my conversations", no
 *     "fetch messages since"; inbound messages arrive only as webhooks to a
 *     public HTTPS URL you operate, which is the server Zelos deliberately does
 *     not have (non-negotiable #3, and core/server.mjs binds 127.0.0.1). And the
 *     cost of trying is not a rate limit: REGISTERING A PHONE NUMBER ON THE
 *     CLOUD API DELETES THAT NUMBER'S PERSONAL WHATSAPP ACCOUNT. A user who
 *     followed a setup wizard to "connect WhatsApp" would lose the chat history
 *     they were trying to read. There is no version of that which is worth
 *     shipping.
 *
 *  2. THE UNOFFICIAL WEB/MULTI-DEVICE LIBRARIES. They do read personal chats,
 *     and they are out on two independent grounds. FIRST, they cannot ship
 *     here: the browser-automation ones carry Puppeteer, which is a Chromium
 *     download, and the protocol ones carry a native Rust addon — either is a
 *     `node_modules` directory, and CI asserts one does not exist. That is
 *     non-negotiable #1 and it is the product's central claim, not a
 *     preference. SECOND, and this would still be disqualifying if they were
 *     pure JavaScript: they drive an unauthorised client against WhatsApp's own
 *     servers, and the documented consequence is termination of the account.
 *     The account in question is the one holding somebody's family, their
 *     children's school group and their bank's one-time codes. A second brain
 *     is not worth a phone number.
 *
 *  3. EXPORT CHAT. First-party, free, unconditional, no developer account, no
 *     token, no review, and no risk to the account: it is a button inside the
 *     app that hands the user a `_chat.txt` — on its own, or zipped, and
 *     optionally with the media alongside it. That is what this file reads.
 *
 * ========================================================================
 * SO SAY WHAT IT IS. AN ARCHIVE THE USER BRINGS.
 * ========================================================================
 *
 * This connector does not update. It reads a file, and that file holds whatever
 * the conversation contained at the instant the user tapped Export. Nothing new
 * appears until they export again — not in an hour, not tomorrow, not ever.
 *
 * That sentence is in `option`, it is in the `path` field's hint, and `check()`
 * repeats it with the export's own date attached, because the difference
 * between "Zelos reads my WhatsApp" and "Zelos read a file I gave it" is the
 * difference between a product that works and a product that quietly stops
 * telling you about the message that mattered. A user who believes the first
 * one will not export again, and the board will go on showing a conversation
 * that ended weeks ago as though it were current. Framing this accurately is
 * the largest part of the work in this file; the parser is the second largest.
 *
 * `credential: null` and `origins: []` are literal truths and not defaults, the
 * same way they are in folder.mjs: there is nothing to authenticate — the
 * authorisation is the file's own mode on the user's own disk — and `ctx.http`
 * is never touched. Nothing here opens a socket.
 *
 * NOTHING IS EVER WRITTEN, MOVED OR DELETED, including the export itself and
 * including the `.zip`, which is read a few kilobytes at a time through its own
 * central directory rather than unpacked. A media export can be two gigabytes;
 * this never allocates more than the compressed `_chat.txt` inside it.
 *
 * ========================================================================
 * THE FORMAT, WHICH IS NOT A FORMAT
 * ========================================================================
 *
 * "The WhatsApp export format" does not exist. WhatsApp renders each line with
 * the PHONE's date and time formatter, so the file's shape is a product of the
 * exporting platform and the exporting phone's locale:
 *
 *   [2/8/26, 9:14:02 AM] Kit Alder: on my way          iOS, US
 *   [11/08/2026, 09:14:02] Kit Alder: on my way        iOS, UK, 24-hour
 *   2/8/26, 9:14 AM - Kit Alder: on my way             Android, US, no seconds
 *   11.08.26, 09:14 - Kit Alder: on my way             Android, de-DE
 *   2026. 8. 11. 오전 9:14 - Kit Alder: 가는 중          Android, ko-KR
 *
 * iOS brackets the timestamp; Android separates it from the body with " - ".
 * The date order is d/m/y in most of the world and m/d/y in the United States,
 * so `2/8/26` is two different days depending on a fact the line does not
 * carry. Times are 12- or 24-hour, the meridiem may be `AM`, `am`, `a.m.`,
 * `a. m.` or a CJK/Korean marker that comes BEFORE the digits, and Arabic
 * locales write the digits themselves in Arabic-Indic numerals with bidi
 * control characters threaded through the line.
 *
 * On top of that: a message wraps, so one message is any number of lines and
 * only the first carries a timestamp; and a great many lines are not messages
 * at all — the end-to-end-encryption notice, "X created group Y", "X added Y",
 * a missed call, "image omitted".
 *
 * Two structural facts do all the heavy lifting, and both are locale-blind:
 *
 *  - A LINE THAT DOES NOT BEGIN WITH A TIMESTAMP IS A CONTINUATION. That is the
 *    whole of the wrapping problem, and it is why parsing is line-oriented
 *    rather than message-oriented.
 *  - A SYSTEM NOTICE HAS NO "Sender: " PREFIX. Nobody sent it, so WhatsApp has
 *    no name to print. Translating a list of English phrases would have been
 *    the obvious approach and it would be wrong for every user outside the
 *    English-speaking world; the absent sender is true in every language.
 *
 * And one more, which is the trick that makes iOS attachments detectable
 * without a phrase list: iOS puts U+200E (LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK) in front of any
 * content the user did not type — before the whole line for a system notice,
 * and before the sender AND the placeholder for an attachment. So a leading
 * mark says "not typed text", and whether a `Sender: ` prefix survives says
 * which kind. See `classifyBody`.

/**
 * -> {name, how} — how is 'setting' | 'filename' | 'email' | 'unknown'
 *
 * THIS IS THE HONEST ANSWER TO A QUESTION THAT HAS NO CERTAIN ONE, and it is
 * spelled out rather than guessed at silently because `direction` is what the
 * board uses to tell "somebody is waiting on you" from "you are waiting on
 * somebody", and getting it backwards inverts the meaning of every row.
 *
 * An export carries DISPLAY NAMES AND NOTHING ELSE. No addresses, no phone
 * numbers, no marker on the user's own lines — every message reads
 * `Name: text`, the user's included. `ctx.identityEmail` is an email address,
 * and there is no derivation from an email address to a WhatsApp display name
 * that is true in general: nemo@example.com may appear as "Nemo Hale", as
 * "Nemo", as "Dad", or as a phone number.
 *
 * So there are three kinds of evidence, taken strongest first:
 *
 *  1. THE SETTING. The user typed their own name into the source. This is not a
 *     fallback for a failed heuristic, it is the mechanism; the heuristics
 *     below exist so that the common cases work without it.
 *
 *  2. THE FILE NAME, in a two-person chat only. WhatsApp names the export after
 *     the OTHER party — "WhatsApp Chat with Kit Alder.txt" — in every locale,
 *     with only the surrounding words translated. So if exactly two people
 *     speak in the file and exactly one of their names appears in its name, the
 *     other one is the user. This is structural rather than linguistic, which
 *     is why it is trusted above the email. It is restricted to two-person
 *     chats deliberately: a group export is named after the group, and a group
 *     called "Alder family" would otherwise nominate Kit Alder as the user.
 *
 *  3. THE EMAIL'S LOCAL PART, matched against a name. nemo@example.com against
 *     a sender called "Nemo Hale" is real evidence; it is the weakest of the
 *     three and is required to match exactly one person.
 *
 * If none of them lands, EVERYTHING IS FILED AS RECEIVED and `collect` says so
 * in a sentence that names the candidates. A coin-flip dressed as a result —
 * "the most frequent sender is probably you" — would be wrong about half the
 * time, invisibly, and would make the board confidently misleading rather than
 * plainly incomplete.
