/**
 * core/connectors/index.mjs — the registry the sweep, the doctor and the
 * Settings picker read instead of each keeping their own list.
 *
 * Nothing under core/sources/ moved. That is 4,880 lines of protocol code
 * behind 4,579 lines of tests, and it stays the protocol library; this
 * directory is the thin thing the run loop talks to. A connector is a
 * description of a source plus one function, and the whole of the interface is
 * in `assertShape` below — which runs at module load, so a malformed connector
 * fails the import in CI rather than at 07:00 on somebody's laptop.
 *
 * TWO RULES THAT LOOK LIKE STYLE AND ARE NOT.
 *
 * A STATIC IMPORT LIST, NEVER A DIRECTORY SCAN. test/repo.test.mjs reads every
 * import specifier in core/, ui/ and test/ as TEXT and asserts each resolves to
 * a node: builtin or a relative path — that scanner is the guard behind the
 * zero-dependency claim, and a computed `import()` is invisible to it.
 * package.json also excludes core/sources/oauth.mjs from the tarball by name,
 * and desktop/dist/.../Resources/core/ is a copy: a scan would behave
 * differently depending on what got copied.
 *
 * core/config.mjs MUST NEVER IMPORT THIS FILE. core/sources/caldav.mjs:34
 * imports `paths` and `writeFileAtomic` from ../config.mjs; `paths()` is only
 * called lazily, so ESM survives it today, but a registry that imports caldav,
 * imported in turn by config, is one eager call away from a TDZ crash at launch
 * in the module that resolves the home directory. The cost of honouring it is
 * that CALENDAR_KINDS is stated in both files; the cross-check test in
 * test/connectors.test.mjs is what keeps them equal.

     the fallback and explains the ordering in the same breath, so changing the
