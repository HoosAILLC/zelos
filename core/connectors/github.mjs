/**
 * core/connectors/github.mjs — GitHub notifications.
 *
 * `GET /notifications?participating=true` is the reason this is the ninth
 * connector rather than the twelfth. Every other candidate hands back a stream
 * of everything that happened and leaves Zelos to guess which of it was aimed at
 * the user; this endpoint hands back a `reason` — `assign`, `review_requested`,
 * `mention`, `approval_requested` — which IS the answer to "what needs you",
 * decided by the system that knows. A connector that has to infer relevance from
 * a firehose is a connector that will infer it wrong on somebody's repo.
 *
 * FOUR THINGS THIS FILE IS THE FIRST TO DO, AND EACH IS THE REASON FOR ITS OWN
 * PILE OF COMMENTS BELOW.
 *
 *  1. THE CONDITIONAL-REQUEST DANCE THE ENDPOINT DOCUMENTS. `Last-Modified` out,
 *     `If-Modified-Since` back verbatim, and a 304 costs NOTHING against the
 *     5,000-an-hour budget. That is the whole difference between a polite
 *     connector and a rude one: a sweep every thirty minutes is 48 reads a day,
 *     and 46 of them are 304s on a quiet day. RSS already does the ETag half of
 *     this; what is new here is that the header is not an optimisation, it is
 *     the thing the vendor asks for in writing.
 *  2. A POLL INTERVAL THE SERVER CHOOSES. `X-Poll-Interval` comes back in
 *     SECONDS on every response, 304s included, and it is the floor GitHub wants
 *     between polls. `limits.minIntervalMs` is a static number in a manifest and
 *     cannot move, so the live one is carried in the CURSOR and enforced by this
 *     file before a socket exists. Without it, the "Sweep now" button is a
 *     hammer: the sweep's own 30-minute cadence respects any sane interval, and
 *     a person clicking Refresh does not.
 *  3. A THREAD KEY DERIVED FROM THE SUBJECT, NOT FROM THE NOTIFICATION. See
 *     `threadKeyFor`. This is the difference between one board item for a pull
 *     request and six.
 *  4. THE TRIAGE SCORER REACHED THROUGH THE ONLY DOOR IT HAS. core/triage.mjs
 *     scores a message from `flags`, `to`, `cc`, `direction` and `sentAt` — it
 *     never reads prose. So `reason` is mapped onto those fields rather than
 *     only written into the subject line, and the mapping is at `ADDRESSED_TO_YOU`.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE WRITES. There is no mark-as-read, no thread subscription, no
 * `PATCH /notifications`; the interface has no slot for one and `assertShape`
 * refuses a manifest that invents a key. A notification the user reads on
 * github.com simply stops coming back, and the row Zelos already stored stays
 * where it is — which is right: the board is a record of what arrived, not a
 * mirror of somebody else's unread count.

/**
 * The key that makes a conversation with six notifications ONE board item.
 *
 * The obvious key is the notification id, and it is wrong. GitHub's notification
 * thread is not the conversation: mark a pull request Done, get a new comment,
 * and a notification with a FRESH id arrives about the same pull request. Key on
 * the notification and that pull request is two threads, then three, then five —
 * `threadIndex` (core/triage.mjs:403) counts each as a conversation of one, the
 * model is shown five unrelated fragments, and the board grows five items for
 * one thing that needs doing once.
 *
 * So the key is derived from the SUBJECT — the pull request, the issue, the
 * discussion — which is stable across every notification GitHub will ever send
 * about it.
 *
 * `pulls/456` is rewritten to `issues/456` on purpose, and it is not a
 * convenience. Issues and pull requests share ONE number sequence per
 * repository, so `/repos/o/r/issues/456` and `/repos/o/r/pulls/456` name the
 * same object; GitHub itself uses the issues path for a pull request's comment
 * API. Without the rewrite, a review request and a comment on the same PR land
 * in two threads that can never merge — which is the exact defect this function
 * exists to prevent, arriving through the back door.
 *
 * A `CheckSuite` — which is what `ci_activity` is, and which GitHub sends with
 * `"url": null` — falls back to repository-plus-type. That collapses ALL of a
 * repository's CI noise into one thread, deliberately: "the build for this repo
 * needs looking at" is one board item however many workflows failed.
 *
 * THAT COLLAPSE IS FOR BUILDS AND FOR NOTHING ELSE, and the first cut applied it
 * to every URL-less subject. `Discussion` is the other type GitHub sends with a
 * null `subject.url` — see the comment on `subjectPath`, which says so — so it
 * took the CI fallback and every discussion in a repository landed on the one
 * key `github:o/r:discussion`. Measured: two notifications about two different
 * discussions produced one thread key, `messagesInThread` returned both, and
 * `threadIndex` (core/triage.mjs:403) counted two unrelated questions as one
 * conversation, so the model was shown two fragments glued together. Merging is
 * right for builds and a lie about conversations.
 *
 * So a URL-less subject that is not a check suite is discriminated by its TITLE,
 * hashed because a title is unbounded text and a thread key is an index column.
 * Renaming a discussion therefore starts a new board item, which is the cost of
 * this and is worth paying: a renamed discussion appearing twice is a nuisance,
 * and every discussion in a repository appearing once is a defect. A subject
 * with neither URL nor title has nothing to key on and keeps the old collapse.

 *
 * THE HOST STRIP USED TO REQUIRE A SCHEME, and that left the same failure open

 *

       participating to watched, raise how many to keep — and the stored
       validator still describes the OLD question, so GitHub answers 304 and the
       connector says "nothing new" about notifications that were sitting on the
       server the whole time.

       Measured before this existed: a sweep scoped to one repo stores a
       validator; the user adds a second repo in Settings; the next sweep sends
       the old `If-Modified-Since`, gets a 304, and reports zero rows while the
       new repo's notifications were in the response body both times. Widening

       account the validator can hold for a day, so the user edits Settings,
       sees a confident green zero, and has nothing to read.
