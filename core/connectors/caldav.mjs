   * What `zelos doctor` used to ask inside `if (calendar.kind === 'caldav')`.
   *
   * It reaches the server through `ctx.testCalDav` rather than importing
   * `testConnection` beside `fetchRange` above, and the asymmetry is deliberate:
   * doctor's whole suite runs against a `deps` object whose every network
   * function throws, so a check that opened its own connection would be a
   * diagnostic no test could hold still. The sweep injects `deps.fetchEvents`
   * for exactly the same reason; each host owns its own seam and the connector
   * uses whichever one it was handed.
   *
   * The read of the stored password is swallowed on purpose. A secret store that
   * will not answer is already a `fail` on doctor's own "Secret store" line, and
   * reporting it twice sends the reader to fix the calendar. Trying the
   * connection unauthenticated instead lets the server's answer be the
   * diagnosis, which is the more useful of the two.
