/**
 * core/ai-access.mjs — who is allowed to ask Zelos anything, and what they got.
 *
 * SPEC-v2 §1 turns Zelos into a knowledge source another AI can connect to over
 * MCP. That is the one feature in this app that hands a user's mail to a program
 * they did not write, so the governing rule is written down here rather than
 * left to whoever wires the route:
 *
 *   **Off by default, scoped by the user, forever.**
 *
 * Three things make that rule real. This module owns the first two outright and
 * is the door onto the third:
 *
 *  1. **Tokens.** Access needs a bearer token the user minted for one named
 *     client. The value is shown ONCE, at creation, and then it lives in the
 *     secret store like every other credential — `config.json` holds only
 *     `{id, label, ref, createdAt, lastUsedAt}`. There is no read path, here or
 *     over HTTP. Losing it means minting a new one, which is the correct trade:
 *     a token that can be read back is a token that can be stolen twice.
 *  2. **Scopes.** A closed set, each individually toggled, stored in
 *     `config.ai.scopes`. `mail.bodies` is the one that matters and is treated
 *     as such: it is off unless explicitly turned on, and it is never turned on
 *     as a side effect of anything. `setAiSettings` is the only writer, and it
 *     refuses a key that is not in the set.
 *  3. **The log.** Every call is recorded locally with the tool, the scope and
 *     how many rows came back, so a person can answer "what did my AI read?"
 *     The rows are written by core/mcp.mjs — one table, whichever transport the
 *     call arrived on — and re-exported here so the Settings routes have one
 *     import rather than two.
 *
 * The scope set, the tools, the JSON-RPC protocol and the audit log all live in
 * `core/mcp.mjs` and are re-exported here rather than restated: two definitions
 * of "what a scope is" would drift, and the one that drifted would be the one a
 * security decision was made against. This file knows nothing about JSON-RPC —
 * it is the gate, not the road.
