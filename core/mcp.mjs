/**
 * core/mcp.mjs — Zelos as a knowledge source for somebody else's AI.
 *
 * MCP over JSON-RPC 2.0. `handle()` is the whole protocol as a pure-ish
 * function of (request, ctx); the stdio server is a thin frame around it, and
 * the HTTP transport mounts the same function. One implementation, two doors.
 *
 * Three rules shape every line below.
 *
 *  1. **Read-only, with one exception, named in both places.** No tool here
 *     sends, deletes or reconfigures anything, and nothing in this file can
 *     write a row of somebody's mail, calendar or drafts. It writes its own
 *     audit rows in `ai_access_log`, and it performs exactly one repair, on one
 *     table, on one code path: reading the board.
 *
 *     That repair has two halves and both belong to the same rule. `listBoard`
 *     wakes snoozes that have come due — it is a reader that repairs, and it is
 *     imported from core/db.mjs like any other — and `capNowBucket` then holds
 *     the four-item `now` bar, the way core/server.mjs holds it on /api/state,
 *     because a wake is exactly how a fifth `now` item appears with no sweep
 *     anywhere near it. That is the app's own rule applied to the app's own
 *     board, not data going anywhere, and it stays.
 *
 *     What could not stay was announcing it as read-only. `readOnlyHint` is not
 *     a label, it is the field an MCP host reads to decide it may run a tool
 *     without asking the owner first — so a no-argument `tools/call` on
 *     `zelos_board`, auto-approved on the strength of that field, woke a snoozed
 *     item and demoted a `now` one. `zelos_board` therefore ships
 *     `readOnlyHint: false`; the six tools that really do only read still say
 *     true. See READ_ONLY_ANNOTATIONS.
 *
 *     test/mcp.test.mjs asserts the annotation and the behaviour against each
 *     other rather than against this file's text: it calls every tool at a board
 *     with five `now` items and a snooze that has come due, and requires that
 *     the tools which moved a row are exactly the ones not claiming to be
 *     read-only. A source scan could not do that job — the write lives in
 *     sweep.mjs, so grepping this file for core/db.mjs's write helpers looks
 *     straight past it, which is how the claim survived as long as it did.
 *
 *  2. **Scopes are enforced twice, independently.** A scope that is off means
 *     its tools are ABSENT from `tools/list` *and* refused by `tools/call`. The
 *     second check does not consult the first: it resolves the tool from the
 *     full registry and re-asks the scope question, so a client that hardcodes
 *     a tool name it once saw is still stopped.
 *
 *  3. **`mail.bodies` off means no body text leaves, anywhere.** Not "the body
 *     field is omitted" — no body text in any response from any tool. The way
 *     that is achieved matters: nothing in this file ever spreads a database
 *     row into a response. Every message that goes out is built by
 *     `messageView()`, which is the only function that can emit a body and
 *     which reads the scope state itself rather than taking it as an argument.
 *     FTS excerpts are dropped for the same reason — `search()` cuts its
 *     excerpt out of the indexed body, so returning one would leak exactly what
 *     the scope forbids.
 *
 * The data is what Zelos has already indexed. Nothing here fetches mail,
 * refreshes a calendar, or calls a model.

 * Which FTS columns each kind may be MATCHed against, given the scopes that are

 *
 * The index packs several fields into one `body` column per kind — a message's
 * is its snippet and its full text, an event's is its DESCRIPTION plus the
 * location and organizer, an item's is its `why`, the person and their address.
 * A column is therefore not a field, and one restriction written for the whole
 * MATCH is a restriction written for whichever kind the author had in mind. It
 * was: a single `mail.bodies ? null : ['title']` covered every kind at once, so
 * turning mail bodies on also unlocked the events' body column — a mail grant
 * widening what a caller could find in a calendar. Nothing was returned by that
 * (there is no description in `eventView`), but a hit is itself an answer: ask
 * for a word, get an event back, and you have confirmed the word is in someone's
 * calendar. That is the same existence oracle the column filter exists to close.
 *
 * So the restriction is per kind, and it is one rule each time: a column may be
 * searched only when EVERY field packed into it is already readable under the
 * scopes that are on.
 *
 *  - message — the title (subject and sender) always; the body only with
 *    `mail.bodies`, which is the scope that hands that text over anyway.
 *  - event — the title, always, and never the body. `calendar` promises in its
 *    own summary "Not the event description", and the description shares the
 *    column with the location, so the whole column stays shut. No scope opens
 *    it — not `mail.bodies`, which owns no kind at all.
 *  - item — both columns. `board` grants the headline, the `why`, the person and
 *    their address, which is exactly what those two columns hold, so searching
 *    them can surface nothing a board read would not already show.
 *
 * A kind with no case here is unsearchable: unknown means no.

 * was reading something else. Every row used to carry `def.scope`, the tool's
 * nominal one, which for `zelos_search` is `mail.metadata` — so a board-only
 * token searching the board logged a mail read.
 *
 * `used` is what the tool reports it actually spent. EVERY tool reports it now,
 * and that is the point: the repair was made to `zelos_search` alone, and
 * `zelos_item` — which returns whole messages, bodies included, and the drafts
 * behind an item — kept falling through to its nominal `board` and logging a
 * mail read as a board read. A tool that answers with data from a scope says so
 * itself; nothing here infers it from the definition.
 *
 * The fallbacks remain for the paths where no tool ran: the grants that were on,
 * and failing that — a refusal, where nothing was spent — the grants that would
 * have been needed, so the row still says what the call was asking for. Several
 * scopes join with `+`: the panel's scope cell wraps, and half an answer would
 * be the same kind of lie as the wrong one.
 *
 * An ARRAY is the tool's answer and is taken whole, including an empty one —
 * "nothing" is an answer, and it was previously unrepresentable. `zelos_search`
 * reaches it whenever every kind asked for belongs to a scope that is off: it
 * reads no table, and the fallback then named the grants that happened to be on,
 * so a board+calendar client asking for `message` got a row reading
 * `calendar+board`. Only `null` — no tool ran — falls through to the fallbacks.
